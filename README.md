# Elektrikell app

Elektrikell app, was created with React and Bootsrtap help .\
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## About

This app was made as a  graduation project from Frontend courses.
It refleсts and monitors electricity prices in Estonia.  

![Estonia map.elering](https://elering.ee/themes/elering/public/img/front-map/map-elekter.svg)

As a guest, on this aplication, you can - 
 * Choose time and hour interval to see eleсtricity prices.
 * To see best / cheaper time in the future, to use eleсtricity.
 * By cliking button "meist", you can visit another page, and there is more information, about the projeckt creators.


## Available Scripts and Operation / Process

In the `project directory`, you can  find:
  * JavaScript
  * React 
  * React -Bootstrap 
  * Redux
  * React router
  * Sass
  * Html

  `Process` - \
  Information about electricity prices and time, we take from [Elering.ee](http://elering.ee) Api . To build charts with data, we use - [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/). Working with receiving data, are helping us [Moment library ](https://momentjs.com/). For less rerenders, we use Redux.


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
